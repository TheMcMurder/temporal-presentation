# The web moves fast - the standards move slow

- **Backwards compatibility** 
- **Intentionality** 
- **Focus on Primitives**

<!--
Before we begin we need to ouline some challenges with the web.

- The first website ever written still runs in modern browsers
- The Web community is always building new stuff
- Standards take years to complete
-- DVH took 2 years of effort to become a standard
- Trend to focus on primatives that can be combined rather than wholistic solutions
-- Except for observables :sob:
